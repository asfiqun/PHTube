**Project Name:** PHTube

**Description:**
This project is a YouTube-inspired homepage created from scratch using HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript. It simulates the layout and functionality of YouTube's main page, featuring a collection of video thumbnail cards and interactive elements.

**Key Features:**
**Thumbnail Cards:** The homepage displays a grid of video thumbnail cards. Each card represents a video and includes an image, title, and view count.

**Sorting Functionality:** Users can sort the video cards by decreasing view count with the click of a button. This feature allows for easy discovery of popular videos.

**Fully Responsive:** The webpage is designed to be fully responsive, ensuring an optimal viewing experience on various devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.

**Category Options:** Users can explore videos in four different categories: "All," "Music," "Comedy," and "Drawing."

**No Content Handling:** The project gracefully handles cases where a category, such as "Drawing," has no content. It displays a message indicating "There is no content here" to inform users.

**Blog Page Link:** The homepage includes a button that directs users to a separate blog page. This allows for the integration of additional content or information related to the videos or the project.

**Technologies Used:**

**HTML:** The project's structure and layout are defined using HTML to create the webpage's elements.

**Tailwind CSS:** Tailwind CSS is used to style the webpage, providing a clean and modern design.

**JavaScript:** JavaScript is used for handling user interactions, making asynchronous requests to external APIs, and adding interactivity to the web application.
